# My Portfolio

## Description

My portfolio features a terminal based navigation system, where each section of the portfolio is kept as git branches. Navigation utilizes the `git checkout [branch]` command.

The front-end is built on Remix, leveraging on its dynamic nested routes and SSR capabilities.

Airbnb linting rules and prettier were also utilized, along with a precommit hook for precommit checks.
